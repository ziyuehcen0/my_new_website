# Task 2: `gapminder` country comparison

You have seen the `gapminder` dataset that has data on life expectancy, population, and GDP per capita for 142 countries from 1952 to 2007. To get a glimpse of the dataframe, namely to see the variable names, variable types, etc., we use the `glimpse` function. We also want to have a look at the first 20 rows of data.

```{r}
glimpse(gapminder)

head(gapminder, 20) # look at the first 20 rows of the dataframe

```

Your task is to produce two graphs of how life expectancy has changed over the years for the `country` and the `continent` you come from.

I have created the `country_data` and `continent_data` with the code below.

```{r}
country_data <- gapminder %>% 
            filter(country == "China") 

continent_data <- gapminder %>% 
            filter(continent == "Asia")
```

First, create a plot of life expectancy over time for the single country you chose. Map `year` on the x-axis, and `lifeExp` on the y-axis. You should also use `geom_point()` to see the actual data points and `geom_smooth(se = FALSE)` to plot the underlying trendlines. You need to remove the comments **\#** from the lines below for your code to run.

```{r, lifeExp_one_country}
plot1 <- ggplot(data = country_data, mapping = aes(x =year , y = lifeExp))+
   geom_point() +
   geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
# plot1
plot1
```

Next we need to add a title. Create a new plot, or extend plot1, using the `labs()` function to add an informative title to the plot.

```{r, lifeExp_one_country_with_label}
plot1<- plot1 +
   labs(title = "China's Life Expectation ",
       x = "Year ",
       y = "Life Expectation ")
plot1
# plot1
```

Secondly, produce a plot for all countries in the *continent* you come from. (Hint: map the `country` variable to the colour aesthetic. You also want to map `country` to the `group` aesthetic, so all points for each country are grouped together).

```{r lifeExp_one_continent}
 ggplot(continent_data, mapping = aes(x = year , y = lifeExp , colour=country , group =country))+
   geom_point() + 
   geom_smooth(se = FALSE) 
```

Finally, using the original `gapminder` data, produce a life expectancy over time graph, grouped (or faceted) by continent. We will remove all legends, adding the `theme(legend.position="none")` in the end of our ggplot.

```{r lifeExp_facet_by_continent}
 ggplot(data = gapminder, mapping = aes(x = year , y = lifeExp , colour=continent))+
   geom_point() + 
   geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
   facet_wrap(~continent) +
   theme(legend.position="none") 

```

Given these trends, what can you say about life expectancy since 1952? Again, don't just say what's happening in the graph. Tell some of story and speculate about the differences in the patterns.

> Overall, the life expectancy since 1952 was growing in all five continents. In 1952, Europe had the higest life expectancy, which was more than 60 on average.On the other hand, Africa had the lowest life expectancy, which was around 40 on average. Currently, Europe and Oceania the highest life expectancy, which are up to 80. Near them, Asia and America increased to about 70.
