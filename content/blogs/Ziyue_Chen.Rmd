Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r load-libraries, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)  # Load ggplot2, dplyr, and all the other tidyverse packages
library(gapminder)  # gapminder dataset
library(here)
library(janitor)
```
# Task 2: `gapminder` country comparison

You have seen the `gapminder` dataset that has data on life expectancy, population, and GDP per capita for 142 countries from 1952 to 2007. To get a glimpse of the dataframe, namely to see the variable names, variable types, etc., we use the `glimpse` function. We also want to have a look at the first 20 rows of data.
```{r}
glimpse(gapminder)

head(gapminder, 20) # look at the first 20 rows of the dataframe

```
Your task is to produce two graphs of how life expectancy has changed over the years for the `country` and the `continent` you come from.

I have created the `country_data` and `continent_data` with the code below.
```{r}
country_data <- gapminder %>% 
            filter(country == "China") # just choosing Greece, as this is where I come from

continent_data <- gapminder %>% 
            filter(continent == "Asia")
```

First, create a plot of life expectancy over time for the single country you chose. Map `year` on the x-axis, and `lifeExp` on the y-axis. You should also use `geom_point()` to see the actual data points and `geom_smooth(se = FALSE)` to plot the underlying trendlines. You need to remove the comments **\#** from the lines below for your code to run.

```{r, lifeExp_one_country}
plot1 <- ggplot(data = country_data, mapping = aes(x = year, y = lifeExp))+
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
plot1
```


Next we need to add a title. Create a new plot, or extend plot1, using the `labs()` function to add an informative title to the plot.
```{r, lifeExp_one_country_with_label}
plot1<- plot1 +
  labs(title = "life expectancy over time in China ",
      x = "year ",
      y = "lifeExp ") 
plot1
```

Secondly, produce a plot for all countries in the *continent* you come from. (Hint: map the `country` variable to the colour aesthetic. You also want to map `country` to the `group` aesthetic, so all points for each country are grouped together).

```{r lifeExp_one_continent}
ggplot(continent_data, mapping = aes(x = year  , y = lifeExp , colour= country, group = country))+
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) 
```

Finally, using the original `gapminder` data, produce a life expectancy over time graph, grouped (or faceted) by continent. We will remove all legends, adding the `theme(legend.position="none")` in the end of our ggplot.
```{r lifeExp_facet_by_continent}
ggplot(data = gapminder , mapping = aes(x = year , y = lifeExp , colour= continent))+
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~continent) +
  theme(legend.position="none")
```

Given these trends, what can you say about life expectancy since 1952? Again, don't just say what's happening in the graph. Tell some sort of story and speculate about the differences in the patterns.

Life expectancy has been increased all over then world since 1952. Specially speaking, Asia's average life expectancy has rose from 48 to 71, which is the largest span of increase of any continent. This phenomenon may be due to the rapid development of medical standards in Asia, however, Asia's range of life expectancy has been continuously extending as the gap between rich and poor in this area increases each year.


And Europe's range of life expectancy has rose from 62 to 78, which is the smallest span of increase of any continent. This phenomenon may be due to the stagnation of economic development in Europe.
